How to compile the project:

Requirements:
• JDK 8

Our servers don’t support JDK 8, so we compile the project and upload the executables into public directory. And we also upload the JRE 8, which can be used for execution.

You need to open a terminal for each client, server and mapper, cd to the corresponding project directory (CS2510_P1C, CS2510_P1S, CS2510_P1P), and execute the command below.

For client:
cd .../CS2510_P1C/src
javac main/*.java
javac lib/*.java

For mapper:

cd .../CS2510_P1P/src
javac main/*.java

For server

cd .../CS2510_P1S/src
javac -cp .:concurrentlinkedhashmap-lru-1.4.jar:jsr305.jar:EJML-core-0.26.jar main/*.java
javac lib/*.java



For convenience of execution, we provide 4 bash files:
runclient <test cast #> <optional argument>
    For starting a client, test case 1-6, 6 is Mutiply, and takes an argument as the size
runserver
    For starting a server
runmapper
    For starting a mapper
runcopyofmapper
    For starting a standby mapper
